Cold-Warm-Hot game is a deduction game you can play with a friend. Your friend thinks up a random 3-digit number with no repeating digits, and you try to guess what the number is. After each guess, your friend gives you three types of clues:

·        Cold – None of the three digits you guessed is in the secret number.

·        Warm – One of the digits is in the secret number, but your guess has the digit in the wrong place.

·        Hot – Your guess has a correct digit in the correct place.

You can get multiple clues after each guess. If the secret number is 456 and your guess is 546 the clues would be “hot warm warm”. The 6 provides hot (that digit position is correct) and the 5 and 4 provide warm warm (that digits exist in secret number, althought their positions are incorrect). The sequence of clues matters - hot should be always before warm.

5 minutes time periods will be announced by our lovely bell sound.

Please take a look at the example below:
